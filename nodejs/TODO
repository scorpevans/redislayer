debug: indexListQuery sometimes returns NULL instead of []

implement Join expressions i.e. computed fields on joins

make simple checks on interface functions to ensure that parameters are sanitized

capture UIDs separately from member-suffixes for zset; this help abstract better CRUD commands
e.g. some get-commands have to be a range if additional info is appended to the member

one-to-many joins; includiing Offsetting

test

logging and log-levels

buildConfigLookup(config): change most of the functions to lookups, by examining configs onload
also move command properties into command-dict: {, property{ismulti:true, isreader:false, requireuid:true, ..}}

include other cluster types

include object.js layer which would allow compound objects with different config types
this layer can also have validation of fields, defaults, constraints, etc

consider advanced sql-like queries
